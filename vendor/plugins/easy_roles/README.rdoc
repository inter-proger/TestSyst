= Easy Roles

Simple rails gem for basic role authorization with ruby on rails.

== Changelog

Please read the CHANGELOG.rdoc file.

== Install

  gem install gemcutter
  gem tumble
  gem install easy_roles 
  
or it can be installed as a rails plugin.

  script/plugin install git://github.com/platform45/easy_roles.git
  
== Basic Setup

=== Serialize Method

Add the following to your enviroment.rb in the rails initializer block

  config.gem 'easy_roles', :source => 'http://gemcutter.org'
  
(from version 0.3.0) use the migration generator

  script/generate easy_roles user roles

Or add a "roles" column to your users model, and set the default value to "--- []". Please note you can call this column anything you like, I like to use the name "roles".

  t.string :roles, :default => "--- []"
  
Then you need to add "easy_roles :column_name" to your model.

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    easy_roles :roles
  end
  
=== Bitmask Method

==== WARNING: If you plan on using the column name 'roles' for the bitmask method your getter and setter actions will be 'easy_roles' and 'easy_roles=', instead of 'roles' and 'roles='. I would suggest using 'roles_mask' as your roles column for this method.

Add the following to your enviroment.rb in the rails initializer block

  config.gem 'easy_roles', :source => 'http://gemcutter.org'
  
(from version 0.4.1) use the migration generator to generate the roles column for your users table

  E.G. script/generate easy_bitmask_roles user roles_mask

Or add a "roles_mask" column to your users model of type 'integer', and set the default value to 0. Please note you can call this column anything you like, I like to use the name "roles_mask".

  t.integer :roles_mask, :default => 0
  
Add "easy_roles :column_name, :method => :bitmask" to your model.

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    easy_roles :roles_mask, :method => :bitmask
  end
  
And lastly you need to add a constant variable which stores an array of the different roles for your system. The name of the constant must be the name of your column in full caps.

==== WARNING: Bitmask storage relies that you DO NOT change the order of your array of roles, if you need to add a new role, just append it to the end of the array.

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    easy_roles :roles_mask, :method => :bitmask
    
    # Constant variable storing roles in the system
    ROLES_MASK = %w[admin moderator user]
  end

== Usage

Easy roles extends your model, and adds a few methods needed for basic role authorization.

adding a role to a user
  add_role 'role'
  
removing a role from a user
  remove_role 'role'
  
check to see if a user has a certain role
  has_role? 'role'
  # or
  is_role? # role being anything you like, for example 'is_admin?' or 'is_awesome?'
  
For every method above there is a bang method too.
  add_role! 'role'
  remove_role! 'role'
  
== Examples

  @user = User.first
  
  @user.add_role 'admin'
  
  @user.is_admin?
  => true
  
  @user.has_role? 'admin'
  => true
  
  @user.is_awesome?
  => false
  
  @user.add_role 'awesome'
  
  @user.is_awesome?
  => true
  
  @user.remove_role 'admin'
  
  @user.is_admin?
  => false
  
  etc etc

== Protecting controllers

There are many ways to implement views for specific roles, so I did not specifically supply one. Here's an example on what you could do:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

     def admin_required
       unless current_user && current_user.is_admin?
         flash[:error] = "Sorry, you don't have access to that."
         redirect_to root_url and return false
       end
     end
   
  end

Then in your AdminsController or any controller that you only want admins to view:

  class AdminsController < ApplicationController
     before_filter :admin_required
  end
  
  class MarksController < ApplicationController
     before_filter :admin_required, :only => :create, :update
  end
